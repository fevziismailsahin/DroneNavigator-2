ü§ñ AI PROMPT SYSTEM FOR YOUR SIMULATOR



Use the following AI Prompt Template to dynamically generate scenario content (missions, enemy placements, weather effects, etc.):



Prompt:

Generate a high-level military drone mission scenario including:

- The terrain type (desert, forest, urban, sea)

- Mission objective (surveillance, attack, rescue, jamming)

- Enemy types (SAMs, mobile patrols, radar units)

- Threat levels (low, moderate, high)

- Weather conditions (fog, night, wind)

- Required drone type and loadout

- Any signal jamming or communication challenges

Format it in JSON for simulation engine use.



This prompt will allow you to automatically generate mission data from OpenAI/GPT APIs and feed it into your game engine.



‚∏ª



‚úÖ NEXT STEP SUGGESTION



To begin turning this into an actual project:

1. Start with Map + Drone + Mission GUI using Python or Unity

2. Add basic enemy units and simulate vision ranges

3. Integrate simple AI behavior (patrol, detect, engage)

4. Add logging and mission debriefing system

5. Iterate using AI prompt engine to create dynamic content
